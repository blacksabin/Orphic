# Orphic

A minecraft mod that adds many things; a semblance of magic, mystery, and heavy components of alchemy. Cloning, body augmentation, alternate hunger systems, base defense, reasons you'll *need* base defense... And many more. 


## Installation

Standard fabric mod; drag and drop into your \mods folder.

## API

Eventually there will be an API available for other developers to access and integrate their own content with Orphic; unfortunately it is not set up at this time.

## Forge Port

Anyone and everyone has my explicit permission to make a forge port of this mod. I will not dedicate my time to it.

## FAQ

### Q: Will there be a forge port?

Not likely to be made by myself. If this ends up becoming a big enough thing in my eyes, I'll consider reformatting the mod to make Forge Porting easier in the future. As it stands, no.

### Q: Will you update to version XYZ?

No way to know. This is a hobby, and I make the mod for myself and some friends.

### Q: Will you add XYZ feature?

Quite possibly; open up an issue on the [Github](https://github.com/blacksabin/Orphic) requesting the feature. If I like it enough, I'll add it or simply keep it open.
